-- Mathside V23 - Storage Optimization
-- 1) Allow a teacher to delete submitted proof images for assignments they own.
-- 2) After a grade is saved, allow Mathside to clear the deleted proof paths
--    from the submission record so old/broken image links do not remain.
-- Run ONCE in Supabase SQL Editor after the existing Mathside migrations.

-- Students may still delete their own uploaded proof files (used when replacing
